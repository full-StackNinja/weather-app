# Weather App
- This mini project is also the part of the TOP fullstack course. 
- This app reads weather data from [!WeatherAPI.com](www.https://www.weatherapi.com) using built in fetch promise.
- It takes city name or state name and display limited data to the page as I am using freee tier.
- It also handles the missing location data by displaying error message without crashing the app.
- async/await method was used along with then/catch at the outside of the function to fetch data and handle code asynchronously.
